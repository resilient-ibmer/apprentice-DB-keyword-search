Currently: Begin making this into a chrome extension 
        - https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/
            - create a manifest.json file -> https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/
                - action: should use DeclarativeContentAPI -> https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/user_interface/#activate_pagess

TODO:    

    * Style using MaterialUI

    * Look for services in the catalog that you can integrate using IBM Cloud 

    * Organize file structure.
    
    * Make it so that it runs even when dropdowns are open?

    * Refactor traverseProcesses & wordMatcher function in the frontend/

    * Set up some authentication in the backend to make sure requests are coming from approved address
        - CORS configuration

    * Add ability to expand/collapse process categories
        - Ex. There are x processe under "Principles and Practices", by clicking on the category
        you can expand/collapse them, similar to how its done for Work Processes and Competencies

    * Come up with a better solution to scrolling after iterating processes
        - Setting overflow property at the end of script is the current solution.
