Currently: building out function in fetch.js to query database with user inputted keyword.
    - think about the flow of data once the user enters a keyword

TODO:    
    
    * Organize file structure.
    
    * Make it so that it runs even when dropdowns are open?

    * Refactor traverseProcesses & wordMatcher function in the frontend/

    * Set up some authentication in the backend to make sure requests are coming from approved address
        - CORS configuration

    * Add ability to expand/collapse process categories
        - Ex. There are x processe under "Principles and Practices", by clicking on the category
        you can expand/collapse them, similar to how its done for Work Processes and Competencies

    * Come up with a better solution to scrolling after iterating processes
        - Setting overflow property at the end of script is the current solution.
